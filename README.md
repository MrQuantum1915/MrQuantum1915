# Hola, Visitor! ðŸ¤Ÿ 
Iâ€™m **Darshan Patel** (a.k.a. *MrQuantum1915*), an undergraduate Computer Science student.

---

- I am driven by the field of computer science, and I am particularly interested in **AI/ML**, **Cybersecurity**, and **Quantum Computing** as my future scope and their Applications in real world.. Iâ€™m also driven by a desire to solve meaningful problems and make an impact through technology.

- Always eager to learn and gain knowledge, Iâ€™m curious about how and why things work that way. Critical thinking, deep analysis, and problem-solving are at the heart of how I approach challenges.

- I love to explore new technologies and study their working principles.

- I adapt to newer technologies and tools in the universe of computer science pretty quickly.

- Beyond computer science, I have a deep love for **Physics** and **Mathematics**, and Iâ€™m fascinated by the mysteries of **Astronomy** - especially how technology can help us explore the universe and beyond.
- My curiosity also pulls me into metaphysics and philosophy connecting them with astronomy and quantum level, where deep thinking about reality, existence, and the universe constantly fuels my perspective.

- Alongside my CS studies under the instituteâ€™s academics, Iâ€™m actively practicing **Competitive Programming**, building projects in **Full Stack Web Development**, diving into **3D graphics and animations**, and exploring the beautiful mathematics behind **Machine Learning**.
