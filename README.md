# Hola, Visitor! ðŸ‘‹  
Iâ€™m **Darshan Patel** (a.k.a. *MrQuantum1915*), an undergraduate Computer Science student.

---

- Iâ€™m passionate about exploring diverse fields in CS like : **AI/ML**, **Cybersecurity**, **Quantum Computing**, etc., and their real-world applications. Iâ€™m driven by a desire to solve meaningful problems and make an impact through technology.

- Always eager to learn and gain knowledge, Iâ€™m curious about how and why things work that way. Critical thinking, deep analysis, and problem-solving are at the heart of how I approach challenges.

- I love to explore new technologies and study their working principles.

- I adapt to newer technologies pretty quickly.

- Beyond computer science, I have a deep love for **Physics** and **Mathematics**, and Iâ€™m fascinated by the mysteries of **Astronomy** â€” especially how technology can help us explore the universe and beyond.

- Alongside my CS studies under the instituteâ€™s academics, Iâ€™m actively practicing **Competitive Programming**, building projects in **Full Stack Web Development**, diving into **3D graphics and animations**, and exploring the beautiful mathematics behind **Machine Learning**.
